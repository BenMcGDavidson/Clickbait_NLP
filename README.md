A Natural Language Processing Project to Identify and Predict Clickbait Headlines
Identifying and Correcting Clickbait Links in Social Media through Natural Language Processing
Problem Statement:
    Identify clickbait links from an existing dataset with 92% accuracy, randomly select one of those links and provide an alternative description to it that better matches the content of the article using NLP.
Background:
    Disinformation spreads very quickly on social media due to the use of sensational headlines and descriptions that blow the content of the article out of proportion. This disinformation often leads to significant disconnects between groups of people. Twitter and Facebook both have implemented systems to identify fake news articles, but this doesnâ€™t necessarily catch clickbait links which can often have similar effects. By using NLP to identify clickbait links and provide a more accurate summary of the linked article, we can curb the spread of disinformation and promote more critical thinking. 
Criteria for Success:

    The NLP model will identify clickbait links with 92% accuracy, and provide a more accurate summary of one randomly selected link.
Scope of Solution Space:

    Build an NLP model that accurately identifies clickbait links and provides a better summary of the linked material. This will help readers better understand the actual content of the linked article and hopefully promote more critical thinking.
